Design patterns are the cornerstone to systematic design, letting you focus on iteration and perfection. Stylep (Style Patterns) let you use common design patterns and components that have already been thought out and tested without making any design decisions before you start. Stop re-inventing wheels, and repainting the chrome, just use what you need and style accordingly.

This is not a framework, and it never will be. Stylep is an ecosystem of simple design patterns written in PostCSS, provided by the open source community. If anything, this is a higher level set of features you could use to make up custom frameworks for your projects.

## Install
Using NPM you can install the stylep `syp` command with the following command:

```shell
npm i -g stylep
```

## Usage
You can get as many patterns in one command as you like.

```shell
# Install the button pattern!
spi button

# or uninstall it
spu button
```
